This design uses Beaglebone Black running Linux Angstrom distribution (Embedded Linux kernel). 
Beaglebone Black is a development platform for ARM Cortex processor (1GHz AM3359 Sitara).
The temperature/humidity sensor is interfaced to Beaglebone Black. I2C protocol is used for communication.
The sensor readings are displayed on a 7" LCD.
The software is written in C++
